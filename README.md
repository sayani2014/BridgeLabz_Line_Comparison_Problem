## Usecases
1. As a fan of geometry, I want to model a line based on a point consisting of (x, y) co-ordinates using the Cartesian system, So that I can calculate its length.
  - A Length as 2 Points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) - Length of a Line = sqrt( (x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2 - y1) ^ 2)
2. As a fan of geometry, I want to check equality of two lines based on the end points, So that I know when two lines are the equal. 
  - Using Java equals method to check equality of 2 Lengths is preferable.
3. As a fan of geometry, I want to compare two lines based on the end points, So that I know one line is equal, greater or less than the other line. 
  - Using Java compareTo method to compare 2 Lengths is preferable.
